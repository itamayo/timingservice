# Timing Service

This repository contains the source code of a basic implementation in Node.js using a WebSocket server of an **online timing resource** as defined in the draft [Timing Object](http://webtiming.github.io/timingobject/) specification developed by the [Multi-Device Timing Community Group](http://www.w3.org/Community/webtiming) in W3C.

This is **work in progress**. Do not expect the code to be working yet!
